Run the Jupyter Notebook, Daily_User, to load the users.csv file into a Postgres database.

Make sure your Python environment has the following library installed:
  1) Pandas
  2) SQLAlchemy

Make sure to enter the following when prompted in order to connect to the Postgress database:
  1) Server name 
  2) Database name 
  3) User name  
  4) User password

The following are improvements for the notebook:
  1) Add error handling for when the user enters the wrong credentials
  2) Add error handling if the database connection fails
  3) Prompt the user if they want to append or replace the data in the database tables
